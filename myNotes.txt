I am having trouble with responsiveness.
When I reduce the width of the screen, the height of the stats-card increases whilst the hero image decreases. This causes a separation between the border of the image and the internal edge of the container.

I have tried setting a minimum width and height on the container so that it cannot create a shape that exposes the edge of the image, but this is too ridgid and doesn't work anyway.

My idea is to use the media query tool to create a situation where if the screens width reaches this point, the width and height of the container must be preserved and respond together to protext the image edges.

This is the second time this has occurred, so I really want to solve this and log the solution, because it will probably happen regularly.
